I am afraid that since I choose this memory, it invalidates the importance of my other ones. If the memory I would choose to keep to keep came from twhen I was in the 7th grade ,didn’t that technically mean that I didn’t really do anything substantial in the last five year that was worth remembering?

Furthermore, if I only choose to remember my sister and I, what about all my other friends?If I am not going to remember my ineteractions with other people, did that mean my friendship wasn’t as long lasting or valuable as I say they are. What does Best Friends Forever mean if forever is just a couple of decades.,.

For the person I did choose to have my last memory with, there are a lot of memories that I didn’t choose. If I am not willing to remember them, what guaranteed do I have that they would choose to remember me? And does this mean that everything I ever do will only live on through my memory and if I’m very lucky, one other person. It’s unlikely that my sister has any recollection of this memory and if she does, she probably doesn’t remember it fondly. She probably remembers trying to go to sleep after studying (or so she says) for Physics or some other wordy college course. I heard her climb up those stairs, open the closet door, go to the bathroom, and come to sleep next to me. She probably remembers trying to go to sleep but being bothered by a little voice, muffled under thick, pink covers. I don’t quite remember our conversation verbatim but I have spent the last 18 years with her so I know her well enough to be able to fill in some of her sarcastic hormone-driven phrases: just filled in some of the gaps:

“Helloooo”

“Why are you still up?"

"I can't sleep"

"Why"

"I don't know"

Okay

...
...
During this time, I assume my sister has given up on whatever I was doing to go to sleep

"So what were you doing before?"

"Studying"

So she says.

"Do you have a test tomorrow?"

"Yea"

"You should get some sleep then."

"Yea"
